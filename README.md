# Advent of Haskell λ

Here I write my learning programs in Haskell λ

I use [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/) and a good font [Lotion](https://font.nina.coffee/)

### Directories

**Elemantary**

- [x] Write a function to add two numbers.
- [x] Create a function that checks if a number is even.
- [x] Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
- [x] Write a recursive function to find the nth Fibonacci number.
- [x] Implement a function to reverse a list.
- [x] Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
- [x] Write a program to find the maximum element in a list.
- [x] Implement a function to remove duplicate elements from a list.
- [x] Create a function that multiplies all elements in a list.
- [x] Write a program to calculate the sum of squares of elements in a list.
